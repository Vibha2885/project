                The story of Rani Padmavati, often called
                Padmavati or Padmini, is primarily known
                from the epic poem "Padmavat" written by
                Malik Muhammad Jayasi in the 16th century.
                While historical records of the siege of
                Chittor by Alauddin Khilji exist, the existence
                of Padmavati as a historical figure is debated by historians.
